# Search and Information retrieval crash course

Hello and welcome to this crash course on search and information retrieval!

Search is everywhere. It's an essential part of our lives. Imagine life without Google!

The more technical term for search is Information Retrieval. There are some nuances, but for now, I will use the terms interchangeably.

In an ideal world, search.... _just works_. Basically, you look for something on the internet and the search engine knows _exactly_ what you are looking for and gives it to you.
Google has done a great job regarding this. If you search for an airport, it shows you flights from your nearby airport. If you search for a restaurant, it shows you a little pop up which shows the menu, reviews, how busy the restaurant is etc etc. It's pretty incredible, to be honest.
 
All of these advancements in the field of IR has been a result of almost half a century of academia + corporate research and 10s of billions of dollars spent on R&D.

More recently, machine learning and artificial intelligence is changing how we think about search.

Search is quite a complex topic which requires general IR knowledge, domain understanding and data for personalization.
 For this tutorial, I am going to be focussing on just the IR concepts. 

By going through the various levels, you can get a basic understanding of how search works and has progressed over the years. We will be using a movie dataset to go through this tutorial. 
This tutorial is still under progress so don't forget to star the repo to check back later! \
