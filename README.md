# Search and Information retrieval crash course

Hello and welcome to this crash course on search and information retrieval.

Search is everywhere. It's an essential part of our lives. Imagine life without Google!

The more technical term for search is Information Retrieval. There are some nuances, but for now, I will use the terms interchangeably.

In an ideal world, search.... _just works_. Basically, you look for something on the internet and the search engine knows _exactly_ what you are looking for and gives it to you.
Google has done a great job regarding this. If you search for an airport, it shows you flights from your nearby airport. If you search for a restaurant, it shows you a little pop up which shows the menu, reviews, how busy the restaurant is etc etc. It's pretty incredible, to be honest.
 
All of these advancements in the field of IR has been a result of almost half a century of academia + corporate research and 10s of billions of dollars spent on R&D.

By going through the various levels in the tutorial, you can get a basic understanding of how search works and has progressed over the years.
