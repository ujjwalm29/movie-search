# Embeddings through APIs and Matryoshka representation learning powered embeddings

Welcome to level 5 of the Search and Information Retrieval Crash Course! Hope you're enjoying it!

For this level, I have written a medium article : [medium](https://ujjwalm29.medium.com/matryoshka-representation-learning-a-guide-to-faster-semantic-search-1c9025543530)

MRL-powered embeddings are extremely recent and there are a total of 0 implementation guides that exist on using them. So, I thought, why not spread the word.

Anyways, I hope you enjoy it!
